# kitchen-tiling-calculator
This project calculates the number of square tiles required to cover a rectangular kitchen floor. The user inputs the tile size and the kitchen dimensions, and the program uses the ceil function to ensure enough full tiles are purchased, rounding up any fractional results. It also includes assertions to validate all input values are positive.
